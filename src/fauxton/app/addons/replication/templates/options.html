<div class="advancedOptions hide">
	<h4>Apply filters</h4>
	<p>Sometimes you don't want to transfer all documents from source to target. You can include one or more filter functions in a design document on the source and then tell the replicator to use them.</p>
	<label for="filter">Enter the design doc and filter name</label>
	<input type="text" placeholder="myddoc/myfilter" name="filter" id="filter"/>
	<label for="query">Add query parameters (optional)</label>
	<input type="text" placeholder='{"key":"value"}' name="query_params" id="query"/>

	<hr>
	<h4>Named Document Replication</h4>
	<p>Sometimes you only want to replicate some documents. For this simple case you do not need to write a filter function. Simply add the list of keys, separated by commas.</p>
	<input type="text" placeholder="foo, bar, baz" name="doc_ids" id="doc_ids"/>

	<hr>
	<h4>Replicate through a proxy</h4>
	<p>Pass a "proxy" argument in the replication data to have replication go through an HTTP proxy</p>
	<input type="text" placeholder="http://localhost:8888" name="proxy" id="proxy"/>
